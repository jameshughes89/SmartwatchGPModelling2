'''
Generates the accuracy curve for the data based on the number of data poitns in GROUP SIZE
Also generates the accuracy matrices too. 

*
****************
NOTE TO JAMES:
		What if there was a curve for each task? May emphasize what tasks suck?

**** IMPORTANT NOTE IF USING THIS SCRIPT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE! ****
(Might kinda' ruin the randomness though... so, idk)
I have a strong feeling that I could make this WAY FASTER IF:
- Only calculate on the max value of GROUP_SIZE (120 in this case)
- Store all the values, so I have a 120 rows x 100 cols
- Calculate each GROUP_SIZE's error by doing the mean of the first 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc. rows
- I'm pretty sure that will work, and it will make it run WAY FASTER!
